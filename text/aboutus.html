          Welcome to <strong>KRI</strong>! We're two students who created this
          platform to make life easier for other students. We know how
          challenging it can be to find the right place to live, especially when
          you're busy with studies. That's why we designed an easy-to-use
          website where students can quickly find rental options that match
          their needs and budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Our goal is simple:</b> to make finding a place fast, safe, and
          accessible. We hope our platform helps you find the perfect spot for
          both your studies and everyday life.
